	    This is ICSS the Instructor & Client Scheduling System. This is a simple scheduling system that takes into account 3 different schedules and easily assists the user in managing them. The system was created for a music school that needed to keep track of their clients and instructors in each room throughout the day. It also allows for an admin to manually book lessons and update user information as well as view multiple types of data to book each lesson. We used a thorough and concise database to monitor and manage all of the external users through availabilities and lessons. There is even a handy payment tracking system to tell who has paid, how much, and for what.
